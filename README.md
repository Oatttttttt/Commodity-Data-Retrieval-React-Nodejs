# Commodity Data Retrieval from RapidAPI with React and Node.js
This project involves the development of a web application that retrieves commodity data from the RapidAPI platform using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The application integrates with the RapidAPI-hosted commodity rates API to fetch the latest data.

## Frontend (React)
The frontend is developed using React, providing a user interface to display the commodity data fetched from the backend server. It includes components designed to present the commodity rates in a clear and user-friendly manner, ensuring an intuitive user experience.

## Backend (Node.js with Express)
The backend consists of a Node.js server implemented with the Express framework. This server acts as a bridge between the frontend and the RapidAPI service. It handles incoming requests from the frontend for commodity data and forwards them to the appropriate endpoint on the RapidAPI platform. Additionally, the server manages authentication with RapidAPI using the provided API key to ensure secure access to the commodity rates.
